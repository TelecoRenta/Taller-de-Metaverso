# Taller-de-Metaverso


Workshop title: ***Taller de Metaverso: Realidad virtual***

The goal of the workshop is to bring undergraduate students the opportunity to immerse themselves in a unique experience that will allow them to interact with a
virtual environment in a whole new way.

The workshop is supported by the **PDF guides** that consist in one guide for the instructor and another guide for the student following this workshop 

In addition to the above files, it is recomended to use a virtual reality headset. This headset is not provided as part of the workshop and should be acquired by the organizers of the workshop.
